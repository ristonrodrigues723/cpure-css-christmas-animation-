# Pure CSS Christmas Animation 🎄 (Cascade YSWS)

## Description ❄️

Get ready to bring some winter magic to your website! This is a **pure CSS snowfall animation** that fills the screen with beautiful, randomly falling snowflakes. It’s lightweight, completely JavaScript-free, and adds a serene winter vibe to any project. Originally created for **Cascade YSWS**, but soon, I’ll be adding JavaScript, theme changes, snow variations, and even better elements for a complete holiday makeover!

## Features ✨

- Full-screen **snowfall effect**
- **Responsive design** for all devices
- Snowflakes with different **sizes** and **falling speeds**
- Completely **JavaScript-free**

## How It Works 🔧

This animation is powered by CSS `@keyframes` magic:
- **Snowflakes** are positioned absolutely across the screen.
- Each one has unique properties:
  - **Size**
  - **Horizontal position**
  - **Falling duration**
  - **Animation delay**

## Installation 📂

1. **Download** `index.html` and `styles.css`.
2. Place the files in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser and enjoy the snow!

## Customization 🎨

You can easily tweak the snowflake properties in the CSS to make it your own:
- Change the **snowflake colors**.
